The potential absence of proper safeguards, human oversight, and the use of competitors' sensitive data could increase the risk of anti-competitive behaviour, particularly when similar AI models are deployed across the industry. To avoid potentially infringing section 34 of the Competition Act, which prohibits agreements that prevent, restrict, or distort competition within Singapore, the business should review and consider incorporating a more diverse set of factors or practices that are not derived from other businesses’ models or decisions. The business should also implement safeguards to prevent the sharing of commercially sensitive data and model parameters between competitors, and ensure proper human oversight of AI outputs to detect potential collusive behaviour. Where the same AI model is widely used across competitors, additional measures should be taken to prevent anti-competitive coordination of business decisions. 
    Additionally, the business’s AI algorithm could be engaging in algorithmic exclusion or predation through the implementation of below cost pricing or loyalty-inducing algorithms. If the business is dominant, it should review the AI algorithm for any instances of below cost pricing or loyalty-inducing tendencies to avoid potentially infringing section 47 of the Competition Act, which prohibits the abuse of a dominant market position that is not based on fair competition and perpetuates the dominant position of the business.`
