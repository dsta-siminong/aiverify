  <h4> <b>Recommendations</b> </h4>
  <p>The test results enable the business to understand key factors affecting the AI model's recommendation. The potential use cases (non-exhaustive) are as follows:</p>
  <p><u>Algorithmic collusion</u> </p>
  <p>If a feature relating to competitors’ business models or decisions has a high value on business’s decision, the business could potentially be engaging in algorithmic collusion if the algorithm is designed to coordinate changes with other competitors and/or facilitate anti-competitive agreements.</p>
  <p>To avoid potentially infringing Section 34 of the Competition Act, which prohibits agreements that prevent, restrict, or distort competition within Singapore, the business should review and ensure that its AI model considers a diverse set of factors or practices that are not derived from other businesses' business models or decisions.</p>
  
  <p><u>Anticompetitive algorithms leading to foreclosure</u></p>
  <p>If a feature relating to customer’s loyalty (eg. years of subscription) has a high value on whether a discount is provided, the business’s algorithm could potentially be engaging in loyalty inducing behaviour.</p>
  <p>If the business is dominant, it should review the AI algorithm to avoid potentially infringing Section 47 of the Competition Act, which prohibits the abuse of a dominant market position that is not based on fair competition and perpetuates the dominant position of the business.</p>

  <p><u>Discriminatory treatment or Dark patterns </u></p>
  <p>If a feature relating to consumer’s profile (eg. age) has a high value on business’s pricing decisions or choice of user interface for its products, the business’s algorithm could potentially be engaging in discriminatory treatment or employing dark patterns to take advantage of vulnerable consumers. </p>
  <p>The business should ensure that the AI algorithm does not discriminate and take advantage of vulnerable consumers with discriminatory prices or deceptive website designs.</p>
